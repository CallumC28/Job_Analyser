You will write and maintain automated tests to ensure high reliability in a regulated environment while mentoring and supporting teammates through code reviews, documentation, and technical leadership. How You’ll Grow With Us At the Lab, you'll experience the best of both worlds: the stability of an established company with over 20 years of expertise and the dynamic momentum of a startup driven by continuous progress. You'll have the unparalleled opportunity to forge meaningful relationships, design impactful systems, and craft strategies that shape the future of virtual experiences.

Software Engineer – Platform & Systems
		    CrossTerra","San Francisco, CA, United States","Software Engineer – Platform & Systems New CrossTerra San Francisco, CA, United States Job Title Software Engineer – Platform & Systems Job Description CrossTerra is building the infrastructure to power seamless cross-border commerce—fulfillment, localization, payments, and marketplace integrations that work across borders and systems. Our stack spans APIs, Lambdas, multi-tenant frontends, and cloud-native infrastructure. Your job is to help us scale it the right way. We're looking for a senior engineer who can execute at a high level within a systems-oriented environment. You’ll bring clarity, structure, and repeatability to projects. You'll work closely with the CTO to turn a scalable vision into reality through clean code, sound architecture, and great tooling. This is a hands-on role. You'll be working in a modern polyglot stack with opportunities to shape patterns, ship features, and write infrastructure code. We expect engineers to make smart use of AI to move faster and maintain quality. What You’ll Do Implement and evolve standards across Python Lambdas, TypeScript frontends, Terraform modules, and container infrastructure—adhering to an emerging set of platform defaults. Refactor and abstract: take complex logic or brittle services and turn them into clean interfaces others can build on. Own key workflows such as CI/CD pipelines, observability layers, dev containers, and local development tooling. Contribute to new services: help stand up new event-driven Lambdas and APIs tied to logistics, customs, payments, and catalog sync. Leverage AI tools productively: use Cursor, Codex, ChatGPT, and similar tools to accelerate coding, documentation, test-writing, and refactors. Collaborate cross-functionally with product and other engineers to deliver robust, well-tested features on clear timelines. Write documentation that scales — from README guides to design notes that explain how and why a system works. Our Stack APIs & Lambdas: Python 3.11 (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, AWS Lambda, EventBridge, Poetry) Frontends: Next.js (App Router, SSR, Tailwind, Ant Design) Infrastructure: Terraform, ECS/Fargate, Docker, RDS, S3, Secrets Manager, EKS Dev Tooling: DevContainers, GitHub Actions Data & Feeds: PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch (IK/Nori), Shopify, DeepL Observability: OpenTelemetry, CloudWatch, Grafana Process: PR-driven, structured onboarding, docs-first culture Restrictions Telecommuting is OK Agencies are OK Requirements You might be a fit if you: Have 7+ years of experience building backend systems and infrastructure in fast-paced environments. Write clean, maintainable Python and TypeScript—and know how to make that work in a Dockerized, cloud-native environment. Understand how to ship features without accumulating debt, and how to pay it down when needed. Have strong instincts for system boundaries, testability, and deployment safety. Know how to use AI tools to speed up development and eliminate repetition without compromising clarity. Communicate clearly in PRs, docs, and Slack—and default to transparency. Are energized by shipping real systems, not just debating architecture. Bonus points for: Experience with commerce, logistics, or marketplace platforms. Familiarity with Alibaba Cloud, DevOps pipelines, or deploying within mainland China. Contributions to shared tooling, infra modules, or open source libraries. Building systems that support multi-market, multi-language, or multi-tenant deployments. About the Company CrossTerra is an early-stage company building the infrastructure to power global commerce. We help merchants scale across borders by making localization, fulfillment, and payments seamless and interoperable. Our goal is to make cross-border growth feel like local growth—without the usual friction. Why This Role Matters You’ll be a key executor in making our growing stack scalable, maintainable, and understandable by others. This is a rare opportunity to join a platform early and help operationalize good ideas into good defaults.

Amsterdam, Netherlands","Senior Full-Stack Product Engineer
		    SOUS","Amsterdam, Netherlands","Senior Full-Stack Product Engineer SOUS Amsterdam, Netherlands Job Title Senior Full-Stack Product Engineer Job Description Over 2 million food & beverage (F&B) businesses operate in the EU. 60% face failure within their first year 80% in five years. SOUS is here to change that. We’re building a platform that empowers independent F&B creators to thrive—unlocking new revenue streams, cutting costs, and scaling online growth with ease. From e-commerce to delivery management to building loyal communities, we’re reimagining how independent F&B brands grow in a digital-first world. In just two years, we’ve scaled rapidly, onboarded top talent, and brought in over €8M in sales for our clients. Now, we’re evolving—transitioning to a SaaS-first model that will shape the future of the €100B independent F&B market. To make this vision a reality, we’re searching for a Senior Full-Stack Product Engineer who’s as excited about building great products as they are about leading a team. If you’re ready to roll up your sleeves, write brilliant code, and influence the technical direction of a high-growth startup, we’d love to meet you. Restrictions No telecommuting No Agencies Please Requirements TASKS Code, Build, and Ship (70%-80% of your time): Develop and refine our core backend (Django) and frontend (React + TypeScript). Create and improve APIs for users, orders, shipping, and partner tools. Build smart integrations with tools like Shopify and Mendrix. Scale and optimize cloud hosting on GCP (and AWS in the future). Ensure our stack is clean, scalable, and future-proof. Product Engineering (20%-30% of your time): Architect and scale multi-tenant SaaS solutions for the next phase of SOUS. Collaborate with product, design, and operations teams to align technical plans with business goals. Set the bar for code quality, testing (TDD/BDD), and CI/CD workflows. Mentor developers to help them grow while creating a culture of engineering excellence. Identify opportunities to innovate and improve. REQUIREMENTS Hands-On Experience: You’ve been in the trenches as a full-stack developer for 6+ years, and you’re fluent in Python (Django) and JavaScript/TypeScript (React). You’ve built and scaled SaaS applications that are battle-tested in production. Your database game is strong—PostgreSQL and ORMs are second nature to you. Leadership in Action: You’ve led teams, balancing writing code with mentoring and decision-making. You can architect systems that are both elegant and robust while keeping your hands dirty in the codebase. Smart Development Practices: Testing isn’t just a buzzword for you—it’s how you build (Pytest, React Testing Library). You’re fluent in Git workflows and CI/CD tools (e.g., Bitbucket Pipelines). API experience: Deep experience in building and integrating APIs—whether it’s RESTful APIs, JWT Auth, or third-party tools like Shopify and Mendrix. Frontend Know-How: Modern frameworks (React, MUI) are where you shine. You know how to make frontends fast, responsive, and delightful. Bonus Points For: Experience with Firebase (Auth, Hosting) or Google Analytics. Building SaaS platforms and multi-tenant architectures. A background in e-commerce, marketplaces, or scaling startups. WHY SOUS? Competitive Salary + Equity: €85k + options—you’ll grow with us. Shape the Future: Your contributions will define what SOUS becomes. Flexibility: While we’re primarily on-site, we value flexibility when it makes sense. Passion-Driven Team: Join a group of foodies and techies who love solving big problems. High Impact: Be part of a mission that’s changing the way F&B creators succeed. WHAT TO EXPECT IN THE HIRING PROCESS: A 30-minute intro call to get to know each other. A 60-minute technical deep dive. A take-home project (with a 90-minute review session). A 45-minute cultural alignment chat to see if we’re a match. Ready to make an impact? Let’s build something incredible together.
